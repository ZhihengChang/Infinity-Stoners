Proggress update (10/29-11/5)

### What we did last weeK?

We created different classes in java (We decided to switch from python to java); Card, Deck, Player, Game, Rank, and Runner. Each
class controls a different part of the game. Card is an object and will represent each card in the game.  Deck and pile are 
lists that will hold different packets of cards. Pile can shuffle, split, and add the cards while deck will deal and remove cards.
Player represents each player in the game and keeps their score. The rank class will hold the value for each card.  Game and runner
will keep the rules of the game and keep it running until someone quits or the game comes to a natural end.

### What will we do this week 1?

We have not yet finished these classes.  Only the card, pile, and rank classes have been fully implemented.  We still need to finish
the other classes in order to get a fully working game.  That is what we plan on doing this week. We must finsh the run class so
the game runs in a correct order. The player class need to incorporate the deck pile and card classes
in orger to take its turn. The deck still need more actions programed in it.  And finally the game needs to utilize all the classes and run the game correctly. By next monday we should have a playable game on one laptop with two users in eclipse.

### Any issues/challenges need to be addressed?

The only challenge we know we will face is connecting sockets in java to make it an online game. We have done something like this in 
python but not java. As a group we've started research so that we will have an idea of what to do once we've completed the game.
Other than this we are confident we can finish the project on time and have a fully functioning game.

### Week 2

1. Last week our team completed our 'Deck' and 'Player' classes
2. This week our goal is to start developing a graphical interface that shows the opponent's card and the player's card. We may further develop the graphical interface as time allows. We will also continue to work on perfecting our socket connections in order to get the game working properly on two computers.
3. We are stil having trouble with the multiplayer capability, but since we are done with the base code-- after intensive testing, we will focus our strengths on establishing a socket connection to create a multiplayer game.
