# Comments
1. Good description of the game scenario
2. Need to be more specific on the deliverables by adding description to each of the items in the deliverables section 

For example:
* Cardgame backend: What do you implement for the backend?
3. Adjust the plan as we have total 5 weeks for the project and rougly 4 weeks for implementation.
4. ProgressUpdates.md is missing!
